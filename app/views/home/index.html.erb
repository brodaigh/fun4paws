Thank you so much for your emails offering foster care for the domestic pet survivors of the Victorian bush fires. You should be as encouraged as we have been at the generosity and compassion shown by the Victorian community.  

Our apologies for the delay in our response however we have received well over 10,000 emails that presented some problems for our service provider.  ___________________ have kindly donated their professional services to assist us in our communication systems. This will allow us to be more effective in meeting the needs of the pets in need.  

The pets coming out of the fire-affected areas are undeniably traumatised, as are their families. The longevity of this service is an unknown factor and we look forward to your ongoing support.

To assist us in matching the domestic pets in need to the best-suited foster carers, please continue on to the following questionnaire.

We are committed for the long term to supporting not only the pets in need but also the foster carers. 

With sincere thanks

Luke Williams, Lynne Fitzsimmons & the team at Fun4Paws.
